In `Choose-Your-Story.xlsm` the user is asked to enter a number into a given cell, then press a number. Depending on the number that is pressed, a different pop up window will appear.

In `hornets_nest.xlsm` the user will see a grid filled with the words "Bugs" and "Hornets". When they press the button labeled "Hornets" a pop up window will appear displaying the number of hornets. Then each of the first 10 "Hornets" will be replaced with the word "Bug". The following 5 "Hornets will be replaced with the word "Bee". If there were more than 15 hornets a pop up window will appear alerting you how many hornets are left. You may change the number of times the program will replace the word "Hornet" with "Bug" or "Bee" by changing the number in cells I2 and K2 respectively.

In `sentence_breaker.xlsm` any sentence may be entered in cell B1. When you press the button "Break Up The Sentence" the cells B4-B6 will populate with the word that corresponds to the number in cells A4-A6. For exmaple, if you have 2 in cell A5 then the second word form the sentence will appear in cell B5.

In `Multiple_year_stock_data` the total change in each stock over the course of the year will be calculated as well as the percent change over that year. The total volume of the stock will also be calculated. Finally, if the yearly change is positive the cell will be filled green but if the yearly change is negative it will be filled red.
